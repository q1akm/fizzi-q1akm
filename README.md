# Fizzi Website - Final code

This is the final code for the YouTube tutorial course where we build a 3D animated e-commerce landing page for the fictional soda brand, Fizzi!

For more information and to watch the course go to the [course documentation](https://dub.sh/fizzi).

## Skip the tutorial and launch the site

If you don’t want to go through the tutorial, but want your own version of the website deployed on Prismic, follow these directions:

1. Clone the code:
    
    ```tsx
    npx @slicemachine/init@latest --starter course-fizzi-next
    ```
    
2. Open the Prismic repository and select “English - United States”.
3. Run the content set up script:
    
    ```tsx
    npm run set-up-content
    ```
    
4. Open the migration release and publish it. A URL will be printed on the screen.
5. Set up the slice simulator URL: `http://localhost:3000/slice-simulator`
